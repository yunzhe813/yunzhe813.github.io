<p>My name is Yunzhe Chen and I am currently a first year computer science student at the University of Waterloo. So far, I have enjoyed the challenges
that university has presented me.</p> 

<p>Before coming to Waterloo, I lived in Shanghai, China for three years and graduated from Shanghai American School - Pudong. I have spent
most of my life in Wilmington, DE and I call it home, but I have lived in a varity of places and visited many cultures.</p> 

<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer with friends, casually or competively. I also taught myself to play guitar and often 
play it to relax a little bit.</p>
